Deploy Apps to your cloud without managing infrastructure

TODO
- read up on websocket & gorilla lib
- make a decision on json data being interface{} or want to put in struct?

- replace all print statements & linebreaks with proper logging (stdout/err)
- Handle when required config files are not supplied/present (or required fields in them not present)
- Is manual management of environments good approach for our use case? Compared to per-PR URLs that people get?
