# cloudfauj
Deploy Apps to your cloud without managing infrastructure

TODO
- refactor http requests logic, take out common code from all methods
- read up on websocket & gorilla lib
- replace all print statements & linebreaks with proper logging (stdout/err)

- make a decision on json data being interface{} or want to put in struct?
- Handle when required config files are not supplied/present (or required fields in them not present)
