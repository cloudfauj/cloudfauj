Deploy Apps to your cloud without managing infrastructure

TODO
- In deploy, how do we tell cli which artifact (docker image) to deploy
- Handle when required config files are not supplied/present
- Is manual management of environments good approach for our use case? Compared to per-PR URLs that people get?
